# Portfolio

#### A portfolio webpage

#### By HK Kahng

## Description

This project started as a webpage for what will become a multipage programming portfolio. It was initially created as an independent project for the Introduction to Programming course at Epicodus (first week, so it is understandably basic and not at all sophisticated). However, the intent is to continue developing this project, not only in functionality, but also in content.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

The initial version of this project will manifest as a single webpage with a number of dependent files in subfolders. It will be published as a GitHub page, thus eliminating the need to upload to a web server.


## Known Bugs

There are no known issues with this webpage. Apart from blandness.


## Support and contact details

Questions, concerns, a friendly "hello"? Contact me via GitHub.


## GitHub Page

As mentioned above, this project will be published as a GitHub page [here](https://eeronomicon.github.io/portfolio).


## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
