            <h4>Costa Rica Suave!</h4>
            <p>This page was an exercise retracing the steps demonstrated in a Treehouse video on Bootstrap. It uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap elements including navbar, carousel, modal, and grid system.</p>

            <h4>The Last Resort</h4>
            <p>This project was a multi-page site for an imaginary island resort. A major obective of the exercise was to create multiple branches that had its own CSS styling and to eventually merge a branch into the master. It uses HTML and CSS.</p>

            <h4>We Still Are the Robots</h4>
            <p>This page resulted from an exercise in exploring the box model and floats. Ostensibly, this is a tribute page to the German electronic pioneers Kraftwerk, but the copy consists of Lorem Ipsum. Uses HTML and CSS.</p>

            <h4>Avocations and Avocados</h4>
            <p>We should not be our jobs. I believe there's a need for a thorough reprogramming of our culture away from the attitude that the dayjob defines the individual. I also believe in the <strong>Renaissance Person</strong> (also known as the polymath or <em>the slasher</em> - as in "I'm a techie/musician/engineer."). Avocations are critical, so don't quit your night job (and eat more avocados, as they're good for you)!</p>
            <p>So, what else do I like to do aside from getting tanned from an LED display?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Music: I play a number of instruments at varying levels of eptitude, including but not limited to guitar, bass, keyboards, mountain dulcimer, jaw harp, and ukulele. I also write and produce music, having released a number of albums and singles over the years under numberous project names.</li>
              <li>Sacred Harp: Recently I've started singing with a group that practices the <em>a cappella</em> folk tradition of "shaped note singing." The shaped note style and songs originate from early 19th century New England but has migrated to and established itself in the South. While these are ostensibly Christian hymns, many practitioners of shaped note singing are of various religious (and non-religious) backgrounds who truly are "in it for the music," which is pretty damned glorious when sun with a hundred other voices.</li>
