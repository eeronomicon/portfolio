            <p>This page was an exercise retracing the steps demonstrated in a Treehouse video on Bootstrap. It uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap elements including navbar, carousel, modal, and grid system.</p>

            <h4>The Last Resort</h4>
            <p>This project was a multi-page site for an imaginary island resort. A major obective of the exercise was to create multiple branches that had its own CSS styling and to eventually merge a branch into the master. It uses HTML and CSS.</p>

            <h4>Why Learn to Code?</h4>
            <p>This portfolio page was started as an independent project exercise that concludes my first week at Epicodus. I intend to continue tinkering with this page as I continue with the Epicodus program.</p>
            <p>I've had the good fortune to grow up in a household that emphasized education and to have had a computer early enough in my upbringing to constantly think "Okay, I'm doing this by hand, but how can I make it easier and/or faster and/or more accurate with a computer?"</p>
            <p>I've worked in a number of industries using a variety of IT systems and platforms to enhance business process and also setting up and maintaining the infrastructures that ran these tools. What I've done previously in terms of coding has been in the cotext of customizing proprietary platforms to make web apps, and I've been wanting to properly learn to make things for the web using the contemporary set of coding tools.</p>
            <p>By nature, I'm a tinkerer. I'll throw myself into the reasonably deep end where I can't feel the bottom of the pool and sort things out. I've done this repeatedly throughout my life, and while I can (and have) tooled around with "learning to code," I also decided that a structured approach would be the most efficient.</p>
            <p>I'd become aware of Epicodus through a couple of friends who had completed the full-time program and made successful career changes from non-technical pasts to full-blown tech gigs. To commit oneself to five months of 40 hour/week code school is... well, a major commitment (and a lot will be "committed" during that time - okay, that was a lame Git joke), but the desire to become a proper code jockey is strong enough to jump into another (reasonably) deep end.</p>
            <p>What would I like to get out of code school? In order of importance:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Learn to code!</li>
              <li>Get a job coding!</li>
              <li>Meet cool folks who do tech!</li>
              <li>Make some cool web apps along the way!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Seem idealistic enough? That was the intent. <b class="glyphicon glyphicon-sunglasses"></b></p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4>Avocations and Avocados</h4>
            <p><span class="text-uppercase">We are not our jobs.</span> I believe there's a need for a thorough reprogramming of our culture away from the attitude that the dayjob defines the individual. I also believe in the <strong>Renaissance Person</strong> (also known as the polymath or <em>the slasher</em> - as in "I'm a techie-slash-musician-slash-engineer."). Avocations are critical, so don't quit your night job (and eat more avocados, as they're good for you)!</p>
            <p>So, what else do I like to do aside from getting tanned from an LED display?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Music: I play a number of instruments at varying levels of eptitude, including but not limited to guitar, bass, keyboards, mountain dulcimer, jaw harp, and ukulele. I also write and produce music, having released a number of albums and singles over the years under numberous project names. I'm also a rather rabid collector of songs.</li>
              <li>Sacred Harp: Recently I've started singing with a group that practices the <em>a cappella</em> folk tradition of "shaped note singing." The shaped note style and songs originate from early 19th century New England but has migrated to and established itself in the South. While these are ostensibly Christian hymns, many practitioners of shaped note singing are of various religious (and non-religious) backgrounds who truly are "in it for the music," which is pretty damned glorious when sung with a hundred other voices.</li>
              <li>Radio: My better half and I have started volunteering at a local low-power FM radio station that is the epitome of DIY. We've been radio geeks forever and have been programming shows at various college and community stations for a goodly while. We play all sorts of music, mostly underground, weird, and/or old.</li>
              <li>Karaoke: I love to singa, about the moona and the Juna-a and the spring-a.</li>
            </ul>

        <img src="img/ilovetosinga.jpg" alt="Best. Cartoon. Ever.">
        <p>This image to the right is from a classic 1936 Merrie Melodies cartoon where a young owlet (eventually revealed to be "Owl Jolson") has to do his own thing to become a jazz singer. Yes, it's a playful tribute to the Al Jolson talkie "The Jazz Singer," and the titular song, "I Love to Singa," is just awesome.</p>
        <p>Be your own thing.</p>
